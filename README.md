# NoShitEmpornium
Script to hide torrents with unwanted tags on Empornium

# Prerequisites
NSE is a JavaScript user script. In order to use it, you'll need to install an extension/addon in your browser that can handle and execute user scripts.

* Chrome/Vivaldi - [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* Opera - [Tampermonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
* Firefox - [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* Safari - [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari)
* Edge - [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=edge)

NSE is developed and tested using Vivaldi, and should therefore work flawlessly in Vivaldi, Chrome, and Opera (they all use the same engine).

# How to use
* Install Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey using the appropriate link above
* Install NSE by clicking [here](https://github.com/ceodoe/noshitempornium/raw/master/NoShitEmpornium.user.js)
* Follow the instructions given by Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to install the script
* Once the script is installed, visit an applicable page on Emp (Torrents, Top 10, Collages)
* Click "[Options]" in the new, blue area below the search center
* Add your list of space-separated tags in the newly revealed text area
* Click "Save tags and reload" to save your tags and reload the page
* Torrents containing the entered tags will now be hidden, and can be shown by clicking the "Toggle X hidden torrents" button

# Important note
If you:

* Use incognito mode
* Clear Emp cookies
* Clear Emp website data
* Reinstall the same version of the script
* Uninstall then reinstall the script

...your saved taglist will be deleted. If you're planning to do any of these things, make sure you back up your taglist first.
