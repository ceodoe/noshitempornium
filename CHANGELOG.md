# Latest changes
## v2.6.8
### Features
- Added an "Open all unfiltered results" button. As the name implies, this button can be used to quickly open all unfiltered results in new tabs. The first time you use this function, your browser will likely only open one tab. Go back to the results tab and it will tell you that the browser blocked the website from opening a bunch of popups. In Firefox, click the "Preferences" button next to the notice, and select the option to always allow popups from Emp. In Chromium-based browsers, click the "Pop-up blocked" button that appears in the address bar, choose the option to always allow popups from Emp, then click "Done". Now the button will function normally on subsequent clicks. The button is enabled by default, but you can deactivate it from Options > Settings > Interface.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where settings wouldn't be properly saved if you tried to individually filter several torrents from several open tabs at the same time (each page had its own local cached lists that weren't updated before taking action on a torrent)
