## v2.7
### Features
On Torrent Detail pages:
- Right-Click Management now works for both uploader elements, not just the top one
- The seeders count will now be highlighted in red if you have NSE set to hide unseeded torrents and there are no seeders
- Both uploader and title fields will now highlight in the same manner as browse pages when a filtered uploader or title phrase was detected

Global:
