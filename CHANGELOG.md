# Latest changes
## v2.7.5
### Features
- Tag coloring based on filter lists now works on your own uploads page, but still won't filter anything on that page
 - Using Right-Click Management to add or remove a tag or an uploader from your lists will now update its coloring on pages where tags/uploaders are displayed. Note that filtering these torrents still won't apply until the next page load, to avoid having to toggle back and forth between the hidden and shown torrent views to take action on several elements within the same torrent.
