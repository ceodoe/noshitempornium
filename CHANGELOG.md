# Latest changes
## v2.7.7
### Features
- Added a button that lets you filter all unfiltered results on the page with a single click. This requires individual upload hiding to be enabled in order to function. The feature is enabled by default, but you can easily disable it in Options > Settings > Filtering > Enable "Filter all unfiltered results" button.

### Miscellaneous
- Adjusted the padding of some buttons to reduce their five-heads
- Adjusted the padding of the settings checkboxes
