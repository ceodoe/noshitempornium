# Latest changes
## v2.5.9
### Features
- Added a new built-in theme: "Dark Purple". With a nice dark gray background color lifted straight from KDE's Breeze Dark theme and purple highlights, this refreshing theme will surely give you a new outlook on filtering content on Empornium
- Added an option to change the font used by the NSE user interface (Default is Helvetica like it's always been, change it in Settings > Options > Interface).

### Other
- Update URLs for NSE and GlobalArrowKeyNavigation.user.js changed to their respective meta.js-files, so we don't hammer GitHub with requests to download the full script every time an update check is done
- Now getting all version information from script metadata block
- Simplify theme descriptions code
